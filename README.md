Pigging Out in Spokane
=============================
## Technologies used
* React
* TypeScript
* Enzyme
* Context

### Version 1.0
I initially built this project much like my previous photo galleries, using React as the framework, fetching mock data of photos with Axios, with a UI to pretty it up.  But with this project, I opted to use Typescript instead of Javascript to experiment with a stronger type-checking subset of Javascript.  This provided me a different challenge of writing my code, needing to ensure correct types for my variables.  I partly based my landing page for this website based off a tutorial for React/TypeScript to feature more functionality.

### Version 2.0
My primary change to this version was to provide state management to the project, using Context to contain my project's state.  Having initially learned it with my [Birthright Israel project](http://github.com/adambodie/israel), I felt this would be a better project to use Context with.  In addition to adding Context for state management, I updated the UI, using different CSS animations, as well as using Animate.css to provide text animation for the landing page and main page.
