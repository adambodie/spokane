During Labor Day weekend, which I was there for, it is the site of Pig Out in the Park, a free festival of many foods and musical performances since 1979.  I wasn't expecting an event at the park, though it didn't surprise me that one would be held on Labor Day Weekend, but looking at all the people and food carts provided an unexpected surprise.  I wasn't planning on attending but I'm glad I did."

The city of Spokane was originally named Spokane Falls before shortening its name to Spokane.  Though the falls themselves aren't all that big nor tall, I enjoyed the scenic views of the river and the city walking along the bridges and the island."

The Monroe Street Dam was built in 1890 and is the longest running hydroelectric dam in Washington.  The lower falls were more impressive than the upper falls, and the viewpoints were closer to the falls themselves.  I spent more time here, mainly from Huntington Park and the view from the Skyride."

Post Falls is the westernmost city in Idaho along I-90, a bedroom community of Spoane and located west of Coeur d'Alene.  Post Falls wasn't the main reason to visit the Idaho Panhandle, and definitely not the most impressive, but stopping in Falls Park and seeing the Spokane River and Dam brought a peaceful feeling in a mountainous Pacific Northwest setting."

The hotel was founded in 1965, but the Lake Tower, its primary building, was completed in 1986.  The resort is known for its golf course, particularly its floating green on the 14th hole.  I briefly entered the hotel, as I had lunch at one of its restaurants, the Dockside, and it obviously looked every bit of luxury that it is advertised.  The scenery around the hotel was marvelous, not only for the Lake, but also the boats and the Floating Boardwalk and footbridge."

Sitting on the shores of Lake Coeur d'Alene, the city of Coeur d'Alene is a popular tourist spot in the region due to its activities along the lake, as well as the Coeur d'Alene Resort.  It is name for the Native American tribe in the region.  Outside of the Resort, the city itself was charming and hip, with lots of fun shops and restaurants.  I found a funky cafe, Calypsos Coffee and Creamery, and had myself a tasty Cappuccino.  Later, I walked in a gift shop and bought a shot glass with a funny logo for Darth Tater.  It was too cute to pass up Darth Tater, but didn't want a shirt, so I got a shot instead.  Coeur d'Alene was an exciting hip place to visit, with beautiful scenery and fun atmosphere, a perfect place to be."

Its nickname is the 'Lilac City,' as it is home of the Syringa Spokane, a pink double lilac variety named for the city.  Spokane is known as the birthplace of Father's Day and famous for hosting the first environmentally themed World's Fair at Expo '74.  Overall, Spokane was a nice place to visit.  The city is big enough to be a metro city, with culture, decent skyscrapers, but also with the less desirable parts that comes with any big city.  The scenery reminded me somewhat of Bend, Oregon, but a bigger population and less of the high desert scenery."

Today, it is home of many gardens, including the Duncan Gardens, Lilac Gardens and the Nishinomiya Tsutakawa Japanese Garden, named after Spokane's sister city in Japan.  I've seen a few gardens, from Portland to Vienna, even Huntsville, Alabama.  Manito Park's Japanese Gardens were peaceful, not nearly as big as Portland's (to no surprise), but nonetheless fitting for a Japanese Garden.  Walking through the best part of Manito Park, the Duncan Gardens, made me think of a much much smaller version of the gardens of SchÃ¶nbrunn Palace in Vienna.  The bountiful flowers, perfectly lined up, along with the fountain in the middle, was the best place to visit in Manito Park."

This wasn't on the agenda of my visit, but its proximity and great views made it a place I wound up visiting and loving.  Walking down the path, getting closer to the bottom, provided great spots along the way, both seeing the falls, but also of the Spokane River itself, and the Monroe Street Bridge.  Looking up and watching the Skyride go down and up the scenic path was fun, providing fun photography opportunities.  As for the Skyride itself, it provided great opportunities for pictures not possible on ground.  My only complaint was that I was stuck in the middle of three pods, so some of my views were blocked with other pods."
